# Express-Legion

Test your express (or express based) API in parallel with a _legion_ of workers.

Every test is completely isolated - even having its own DB instance.

    ONLY SUPPORTS POSTGRESQL FOR NOW!

## Connecting to a Database

`psql -p 20100 -h 127.0.0.1 -d postgres`

## Coming Soon (maybe)
